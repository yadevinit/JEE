# JEE
These have outputs from transformative projects around the JEE (Joint Entrance Examinations), through which a million students compete annually for joining India's premier technology and engineering institutions.
These were created as "Projects" at https://notebooks.azure.com/yadevinit/projects/<projectName\> and that website is retiring: "The Microsoft Azure Notebooks preview website will be retired on October 9th, 2020".
So, those "projects" are being migrated as folders with the same <projectName\>, beneath and within this repository. If some links are broken or some source/data files seem duplicated or worth extracting into a clean versioned set, do let me know so that it can be prioritized and planned for.

Following are the ReadMe pages for the erstwhile "projects" with the more-recently-created ones listed first:
- [JEEMainAdvanced]("./JEE_ Main Advanced/README.md")
- [indtwilight](./indtwilight/README.md)
- [scienceStop](./scienceStop/README.md)
- [JEEavg2max](./JEEavg2max/README.md)
