# JEE
Transformative projects around JEE (Joint Entrance Examination), through which a million students compete for joining India's premier technology and engineering institutions.
These were created as "Projects" at https://notebooks.azure.com/yadevinit/projects/<projectName\> and that website is retiring: "The Microsoft Azure Notebooks preview website will be retired on October 9th, 2020".
So, those "projects" are being migrated as folders with the same <projectName\>, beneath and within this repository. If some links are broken or some source/data files seem duplicated or worth extracting into a clean versioned set, do let me know so that it can be prioritized and planned for.
