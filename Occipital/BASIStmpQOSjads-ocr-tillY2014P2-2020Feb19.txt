Since distance of particle P from point O is initially decreasing then increasing so, its angular velocity will
initially increase then decrease. So, angle swept by P is more than angle swept by disc. So it will fall in
unshaded portion.
Since distance of particle Q from O is continuously increasing so its w is continuously decreasing. So angle
swept by Q is less than angle swept by disc. So it will fall in unshaded portion.

Sol. In physisorption on increasing temperature at constant pressure, adsorption decreases while in chemical
adsorption on increasing temperature due to requirement of activation energy adsorption will increase at
same pressure. So, | is physisorption while II is chemisorption.

Ill is physical adsorption as on increasing temperature, extent of adsorption is decreasing .

tive digits in them are 0. Let b_ = the number of such n-digit integers ending with digit 1 and c_ = the number
of such n-digit integers ending with digit 0.
 Consider the statements :
P : There exists some x € IR such that f(x) + 2x = 2(1 + x?)
Q: There exists some x € IR such that 2f(x) + 1 = 2x(1 + x)
Then
(A) both P and Q are true (B) P is true and Q is false
(C) P is false and Q is true (D) both P and Q are false

A thermal power plant produces electric power of 600 kW at 4000 V, which 1s to be transported to a place 20 km
away from the power plant for consumers’ usage. It can be transported either directly with a cable of large current
carrying capacity or by using a combination of step-up and step-down transformers at the two ends. The drawback
of the direct transmission 1s the large energy dissipation. In the method using transformers, the dissipation is much
smaller. In this method, a step-up transformer is used at the plant side so that the current is reduced to a smaller
value. At the consumers’ end, a step-down transformer is used to supply power to the consumers at the specified
lower voltage. It is reasonable to assume that the power cable 1s purely resistive and the transformers are ideal with
the power factor unity. All the currents and voltage mentioned are rms values.

Paragraph for Questions 13 to 14
A point Q is moving in a circular orbit of radius R in the x-y plane with an angular velocity w. This can be
considered as equivalent to a loop carrying a steady current = . A uniform magnetic field along the positive z-axis
Tt
is now switched on, which increases at a constant rate from 0 to B in one second. Assume that the radius of the orbit
remains constant. The application of the magnetic field induces an emf in the orbit. The induced emf is defined as
the work done by an induced electric field 1n moving a unit positive charge around closed loop. It is known that, for
an orbiting charge, the magnetic dipole moment is proportional to the angular momentum with a proportionality
constant y.

The mass of nucleus 7X is less than the sum of the masses of (A-Z) number of neutrons and Z number of protons in

Number of ions in the solution remains constant until all the AgNO; precipitated as Agl. Thereafter
conductance increases due to increases in number of ions. Hence (4) is the correct match.
(R) Initially conductance decreases due to the decrease in the number of OH ions thereafter it slowly
increases due to the increases in number of H’ ions. Hence (2) is the correct match.
(S) Initially it decreases due to decrease in H’ ions and then increases due to the increases in OH ions.
Hence (1) is the correct match.

Sol. — Salt bridge is introduced to keep the solutions of two electrodes separate, such that the ions in electrode do
not mix freely with each other. But it cannot stop the process of diffusion.
It does not participate in the chemical reaction. However, it is not necessary for occurence of cell reaction, as
we know that designs like lead accumulator, there was no salt bridge, but still reactions takes place.

Sol. Ice is less dense than water due to open crystal structure because of H-bonding.
The basicity of 1° amines is more than 3° amines as after they donate lone pair to H*, they can form H—
bonding with H,O molecules and get easily stabilized by solvation. Where as in tertiary amines, the stabiliza-
tion by solvation is very less.
The dimerisation of acetic acid in benzene is due to H-bonding

Paragraph for questions 31 and 32
X and Y are two volatile liquids with molar weights of 10 g mol-' and 40 g mol-' respectively. Two cotton
plugs, one soaked in X and the other soaked in Y, are simultaneously placed at the ends of a tube of
length L = 24 cm, as shown in the figure. The tube is filled with an inert gas at 1 atmosphere pressure
and a temperature of 300 K. Vapours of X and Y react to form a product which is first observed at a
distance d cm from the plug soaked in X. Take X and Y to have equal molecular diameters and assume
ideal behaviour for the inert gas and the two vapours.

"332" "32. The experimental value of d is found to be smaller than the estimate obtained using Graham's law. This
is due to:
(A) larger mean free path for X as compared to that of Y.
(B) larger mean free path for Y as compared to that of X.
(C) increased collision frequency of Y with the inert gas as compared to that of X with the inert gas.

p = pressure inside the vessel).
.- d& p are same for both gases, ideally their 72 are same. Hence it must be the higher drift speed of X
due to which it is seeing more collisions per second, with the inert gas in comparison to gas Y. So X see
comparably more resistance from noble gas than Y and hence covers lesser distance than that predicted

tetrahedral complexes with these reagents. Aqueous solution of M2 on reaction with reagent S gives

white precipitate which dissolves in excess of S. The reactions are summarized in the scheme given

Sol. §Thisis an excellent question, probably the best in the paper. Pyrolysis of peroxyesters is not conventionally
taught anywhere for IIT-JEE preparation, not even in any standard organic chemistry course. But the
question is throughly logical. It can be answered after a bit of reflection by anyone with good basics of
reaction mechanism.

Four pathways for reactions are given:
P R°+ R'O\"
—CO,
7 O S R +R'O° ———> R’'+X' + Carbonyl Compound
R-C-00? Sa -~CO,
R ~ pr CO, 2. 4Q,
RCO, + R'O° ——+> R’+ X' + Carbonyl Compound
S RCO, + R'O’ _=00*, R' + R'O
l
Note that first homolytic fission is expected to give R-C-—O\" +R’'O°. This is usually unstable (remember
I
kolbe's electrolysis) and decomposes to R*+ CO,. But Ph—C—O' is stable, since it is a difficult bond to
I
break. Hence in (1) & (3), which have Ph-CH,-C-O—-O-R groups, Ph—CH,. will be formed (-.- benzy!
radical is stable) so P or Q are possible pothways for them. For mboor (2&4),R &S pathways
will be more likely.
- 1:PorQ 2:Rors
2:PorQ 4:Rors
Now consider R'O*. If it is CH,O*, It cannot splite.
Gs CH,
-~CH——C—CH Ph-CH I :
But Ph RIAN 3-—> o + IN can occur. Hence carbonyl compound will be formed
Oy O CH,
with 3 & 4, but not with 1 & 2.
- 1:Pors 3:QorR
2:Pors 4:QorR
combining these options gives
1:P,2:S85, 3:Q, 4:R
| cannot but help commenting that such questions are those which make IIT-JEE what it is. A good
motivation for students to keep thinking while studying .

Ans.  (D)
Sol. —_ p(x) will be of the form ax? + c. Since it has purely imaginary roots only.
Since p(x) is zero at imaginary values while ax? + c takes real value only at real 'x', no root is real.
Also p(p(x)) = 0
> p(x) is purely imaginary
=> ax’ + c = purely imaginary
Hence x can not be purely imaginary since x? will be negative in that case and ax? + c will be real.
Thus .(D) is correct.
